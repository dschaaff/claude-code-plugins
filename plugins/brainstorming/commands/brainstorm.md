# Brainstorming Session

Use the **brainstormer** agent to explore ideas and produce a design document.

Determine scope based on what the user provides:
- **Specific feature or idea**: Focus the session on designing that feature.
- **Problem statement**: Explore the problem space before proposing solutions.
- **Nothing specified**: Ask what the user wants to brainstorm about.
